spotifyAlarm / WakeMeUp
===============

This is a really simple spotify app in order to set music play time.

I need designers now...

In order to use the app, clone the app in folder ~/Spotify
Enable the developer mode on Spofidy https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account
Restart Spotify
Go to menu Develop / Show bundle Manager / Apps 
and click on wakeMeUp!

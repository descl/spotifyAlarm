spotifyAlarm / WakeMeUp
===============

This is a really simple spotify app in order to set music play time.

I need designers now...


In order to use the app:


1.  clone the app in folder ~/Spotify
2.  Enable the developer mode on Spofidy https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account
3.  Restart Spotify
4.  Go to menu Develop / Show bundle Manager / Apps 
5.  and click on wakeMeUp!
